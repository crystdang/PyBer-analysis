Overall, the urban areas produce the highest totals and the lowest averages, whereas the rural areas produce the lowest totals and highest averages. There are many possible factors, but as the opposing areas produced vastly different results, likely key considerations are population density, vehicle ownership, and shared route/destination and timing likelihood.
