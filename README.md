# Module 5 Challenge: PyBer Area Type Analysis
## by Crystina Dang using Python v3.9.12

### Overview of the analysis: 
This analysis was requested by V.Isualize to provide insight into future decision making at PyBer, a ride-sharing platform. The data is pulled from multiple sheets and reorganized by area types to produce summaries and charts.

### Results:
*Below is a summary of totals and averages sorted by the three area types:*

Overall, the urban areas produce the highest totals and the lowest averages, whereas the rural areas produce the lowest totals and highest averages.

*Below is a line chart of weekly total fares in 2019 between January to April by area types:*

This line chart confirms the vast differences by area types as no lines intersect and are at relatively consistent distances every week.

### Summary: 
There are many possible factors that could affect the data, but as the opposing areas produced vastly different results, likely key considerations are population density, vehicle ownership, and shared route/destination and timing likelihood.

Based on the results, the three business recommendations for the CEO for addressing disparities among the area types are as follows:
1. Consider adjusting fees in urban areas or seeking alternative insentives for the drivers as their average fare is less than half compared to other area types, whereas the total rides are tripled. This proves that there is demand and additional drivers could significantly increase revenue.
2. Considering the low totals in rural areas that are roughly six times lower than suburban areas, more in depth data of the highest totals rural cities and their bordering suburban cities could provide insight into what could insentivize drivers to travel for work or increase ridership between areas. This could also be done for highest totals suburban cities and their bordering urban cities.
3. Depicted by the line chart, the fare totals maintain a consistent distance across area types for January and February and begins to differ in March and April. The differing distances shows a discrepancy in supply or demand by area types and should be addressed.
