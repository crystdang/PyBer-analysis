# Module 5 Challenge: PyBer Area Type Analysis
## by Crystina Dang using Python v3.9.12

### Overview of the analysis: 
This analysis was requested by V.Isualize to provide insight into future decision making at PyBer, a ride-sharing platform. The data is pulled from multiple sheets and reorganized by area types to produce summaries and charts.

### Results:
*Below is a summary of totals and averages sorted by the three area types:*

Overall, the urban areas produce the highest totals and the lowest averages, whereas the rural areas produce the lowest totals and highest averages.

*Below is a line chart of weekly total fares in 2019 between January to April by area types:*

This line chart confirms the vast differences by area types as no lines intersect and are at relatively consistent distances every week.

### Summary: 
There are many possible factors that could affect the data, but as the opposing areas produced vastly different results, likely key considerations are population density, vehicle ownership, and shared route/destination and timing likelihood.
Based on the results, the three business recommendations for the CEO for addressing disparities among the area types are as follows:
1. Consider seeking alternative insentives for drivers in urban areas as their average fare is under half than in other areas, whereas the total rides are tripled and additional drivers could increase revenue.
2. 
3.
